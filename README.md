## 📌 Problem Statement


Legal professionals spend a significant amount of time manually searching through thousands of case documents to identify:

- Relevent precedents
- Applicable legal laws
- Similar historical cases
- Probable outcomes

This results in:

- Delayed justice delivery
- Increased judicial backlog
- Human errors
- Inefficient legal research workflows

Traditional systems are slow, non scalable, and heavily dependent on manual effort.
